# To run docker through VSCode

`docker run -d --rm --name mongo123 -p 27017:27017 -v mongodbdata:/data/db`

# To run docker through VS

Visual Studio doesn't have a direct UI to run single docker run commands like VS Code terminal, but you can use a docker-compose.yml file in your solution to run MongoDB easily.

### ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step

#### 1. Add a Docker-Compose Project to Your Solution

If you don't already have it:

- Right-click your **solution**
- Go to **Add â†’ Add Container Orchestration Support**
- Choose **Docker Compose**
- Target: **Linux** (Mongo runs best on Linux containers)

This will create a `docker-compose` project with a `docker-compose.yml`.

---

#### 2. Edit `docker-compose.override.yml` or `docker-compose.yml`

Replace or add the MongoDB service like this:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo
    container_name: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongodbdata:/data/db
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  mongodbdata:
```

Note: Even though you're exposing port 27011 externally, the internal MongoDB port is always 27017.

---

#### 3. Set Docker-Compose as Startup Project

- Right-click the docker-compose project
- Click Set as Startup Project
- Press F5 (or Ctrl+F5 if you donâ€™t need debugging)

Visual Studio will:

- Pull the mongo image
- Run it in a container
- Set up the volume and port mappings

# To run docker through VS - Alternative way

add above code to docker-compose.yml file

To Run - `docker-compose up -d`

To stop the container: - `docker-compose down`
